    "A History of Liamland\nas told by billzo at 12:40am\n\n\nIn the wide world of CheezSurv4,\nWith the first wave of humans, Liam spawned in.\n\nAfter nuking the first trees, Liam built a boat.\nHe would row, row, and row a lot.\nSoon Liam first found what he had sought.\n\nIt was an island with a beautiful impression,\nBut behind the facade, Liam viewed aggression.\nCovered with oak trees and surrounded by water.\nLiam immediately knew to have it all slaughtered.\n\nFor several days and several nights,\nLiam nuked trees, all within his sight\n\nHe plundered and skies thundered,\nA lightning strike here, a second, another.\nThe sky roared with the words “death to all trees”,\nAnd the fires ensured that many did deathe.\n\nSoon Liamland had built a factory,\nWith a purpose some called dastardly.\n\nThe factory, it produced mere automatons,\nThings without feelings, without need for rights.\nForced to duck, dawn ‘til dusk and dusk ‘til dawn,\nAll so that Liam could thieve their chidlers in the night.\n\nThese villagers would be placed in Liam’s cave for his slaves.\nThere were severe consequences for those who misbehaved.\nThose who attempted escapes brought out the Liam, cruel, cold, and depraved.\nAnd he would have them mercilessly buried alive in their gravelful graves.\n\nalso remy was appointed founder of liamland at some point i think that happened"
